# Database Connection Pool Fix

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` with the message:
```
Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool. 
More info: http://pris.ly/d/connection-pool (Current connection pool timeout: 10, connection limit: 1)
```

This error occurred because:
1. **Connection pool exhaustion**: The connection pool had a limit of 1 connection
2. **Multiple parallel queries**: The homepage was making multiple parallel database calls to `getProductsByCategory` for all categories
3. **Connection timeout**: When multiple requests came in simultaneously, they couldn't get connections from the pool

## Root Cause

In `app/(home)/page.tsx`, the `CategoryProductsSection` component was making multiple parallel database calls:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE - Multiple parallel database calls
const categoryProductsPromises = categories.map(async (category: string) => {
  const products = await getProductsByCategory(category)
  return { category, products }
})

const categoryProducts = await Promise.all(categoryProductsPromises)
```

This approach:
- Creates multiple database connections simultaneously
- Overwhelms the connection pool
- Causes connection timeouts
- Leads to poor performance and user experience

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Optimized Data Fetching

**Before**: Multiple parallel database calls
**After**: Single optimized query with client-side grouping

```typescript
// NEW EFFICIENT CODE - Single database query
const productsByCategory = await getProductsForMultipleCategories(categories)
```

### 2. New Efficient Function

Created `getProductsForMultipleCategories()` in `lib/actions/product.actions.ts`:

```typescript
export async function getProductsForMultipleCategories(categories: string[]) {
  // Single query to get all products for all categories
  const allProducts = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: {
      category: { in: categories },
      isPublished: true,
    },
    // ... other options
  })

  // Group products by category on the client side
  const productsByCategory = categories.reduce((acc, category) => {
    acc[category] = allProducts
      .filter(product => product.category === category)
      .slice(0, 8)
    return acc
  }, {} as Record<string, any[]>)

  return productsByCategory
}
```

### 3. Connection Monitoring

Created `lib/db/connection-manager.ts` with:

- **Connection pool monitoring**: Track active connections and query statistics
- **Health checks**: Monitor database response times
- **Auto-recovery**: Reset connection pool when failure rate is high
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup on application exit

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added timeout handling for database queries
- Implemented fallback responses to prevent UI crashes
- Added comprehensive error logging

### 5. Caching Strategy

- **In-memory caching**: Cache frequently accessed data for 5 minutes
- **Cache keys**: Unique keys for different data sets
- **Cache invalidation**: Automatic expiration based on TTL

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/actions/product.actions.ts`**
   - Added `getProductsForMultipleCategories()` function
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added connection monitoring wrapper

2. **`app/(home)/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced multiple parallel calls with single efficient call
   - Updated imports to use new function

3. **`lib/db/connection-manager.ts`** (New file)
   - Connection pool monitoring
   - Health checks
   - Auto-recovery mechanisms

4. **`lib/prisma.ts`**
   - Added graceful shutdown handlers
   - Improved error handling

5. **`app/api/health/database/route.ts`** (New file)
   - Database health monitoring endpoint
   - Connection pool statistics

6. **`env.example`**
   - Added database connection pool configuration options

## Performance Improvements

### Before
- **Database calls**: N calls (where N = number of categories)
- **Connection usage**: High (multiple simultaneous connections)
- **Response time**: Slower due to connection pool contention
- **Error rate**: High due to connection timeouts

### After
- **Database calls**: 1 call for all categories
- **Connection usage**: Low (single connection per request)
- **Response time**: Faster due to optimized query
- **Error rate**: Low due to better connection management

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Check Endpoint
```
GET /api/health/database
```

Returns:
- Database connection status
- Response time metrics
- Connection pool statistics
- Active connection count

### Connection Pool Monitoring
- Track active connections
- Monitor query success/failure rates
- Auto-reset connection pool when needed
- Log slow queries (>1 second)

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file for fine-tuning:

```bash
# Database connection pool settings
DATABASE_POOL_MIN=1
DATABASE_POOL_MAX=10
DATABASE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000
DATABASE_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT=30000
```

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Avoid parallel database calls** for related data
2. **Use single queries** with client-side grouping when possible
3. **Implement proper caching** for frequently accessed data
4. **Monitor connection pool health** in production
5. **Add timeout handling** for all database operations
6. **Use connection monitoring** for debugging

## Testing the Fix

1. **Load the homepage** - Should load faster without connection errors
2. **Check database health** - Visit `/api/health/database`
3. **Monitor logs** - Look for connection pool statistics
4. **Stress test** - Multiple simultaneous users should work better

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience connection issues:

1. **Check database health endpoint** for current status
2. **Review connection pool statistics** in logs
3. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Check database server** connection limits
5. **Monitor application logs** for error patterns

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Database indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on `category` and `isPublished` fields
2. **Query optimization**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to optimize the main query
3. **Connection pooling**: Consider using PgBouncer for production PostgreSQL
4. **Load balancing**: Implement proper load balancing for high-traffic scenarios
5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for connection pool exhaustion
